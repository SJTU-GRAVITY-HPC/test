# Jupyter

You can start your own jupyter-notebook on the login node.

# Jupyter hub
Jupyterhub is available at [https://gravity.sjtu.edu.cn](https://gravity.sjtu.edu.cn)

Note the "s" in "https".

```note
Some browsers show warning about the invalid certificate.  You may manually chose "allow", "trust" or "visit the website" in the settings/permissions/privacy options.

# Specify the default python kernel to use module loaded python

By default, the jupyter-notebook use the system python installation as the backend kernel, which may have some functionality/compatibility issues. These are usually resolved by replacing it with the python in the modules. 

For example, to use the module python2 as the default python2 kernel for jupyter:

```bash
module load python/python-2.7.18
ipython kernel install --user --display-name "Python Module 2.7.18"
```
This will creat or overwrite the config file at `~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/python2`.  Now open a new python notebook, and select the `Kernel->change kernel` menu, you will see the newly configured kernel there.

# Add your own virtual env into Jupyter Notebook

To do so, you need *ipykernel* package installed in your virtual environment.

Assume that you have created your own virtual environment named *MYENV* and activated.

Install *ipykernel*, `pip install ipykernel` .

Then configure it 
`python -m ipykernel install --user --name MYENV --display-name "abc"`

The virtual environment *MYENV* is shown as *abc* in your jupyternotebook.
